Shared Dependencies:

1. **Libraries**: All files will likely share some common libraries such as numpy, pandas, cv2, and pytesseract for OCR. The YOLO related files will also share the Darknet YOLO library.

2. **YOLO Configuration**: The "object_detection_yolo.py", "real_time_detection.py", and "yolo_training.py" files will share the YOLO configuration, weight, and class files.

3. **Data Schemas**: The "csv_append.py" and "latex_conversion.py" files will share the same data schema for the CSV file, which will contain LaTeX formulas.

4. **DOM Element IDs**: The "real_time_detection.py" file will need to identify specific DOM elements in the headless browser for capturing content. The IDs of these elements will be shared with any JavaScript functions that interact with these elements.

5. **Message Names**: If any inter-process communication or logging is used, consistent message names will be shared across all files.

6. **Function Names**: Functions for common tasks, such as "detect_objects()", "extract_text()", "convert_to_latex()", and "append_to_csv()" will likely be shared across multiple files.

7. **Dataset**: The "dataset_collection.py", "dataset_annotation.py", "data_preparation.py", and "training_script.py" files will all interact with the same dataset of images containing mathematical formulas.

8. **Model**: The trained YOLO model will be a shared resource used by "object_detection_yolo.py", "real_time_detection.py", and "yolo_training.py".
